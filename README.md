Restaurant reservation web API

This project serves as a part of my [bachelor](https://github.com/mohammadJaliliTorkamani/Lexeen-Reservation-KNTU-Thesis/tree/master) project at KNTU University of Technology in 2020. It is a set of APIs implemented using PHP (and MySQL for database) to help restaurant managers manage customers, orders, and payments. It uses token-based authentication for user management and benefits from message encryption.
